# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code is functional, I have to make sure it is modular and maintainable. Modularity will increase my productivity. In other words, small modules can be coded quickly and have a chance of reuse. In addition, the modules can be tested separately, which will help me reduce the time spent on unit testing. 

I would have to educate myself more on secure coding to ensure my code is safe. Or I can also use integrated tools like Maven to find any vulnerabilities. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program. 
User’s needs are interpreted by first identifying what the client is trying to achieve and pinpointing the final users of the product. After having the information, I would incorporate the user’s needs by coding and testing each case and functionalities. It is essential to consider the user’s needs because they are the main structure for the final product to work correctly.

# How do I approach designing software?
Depending on the client’s needs, I would approach designing software differently. For example, in Contact.java, I first reviewed the requirements and functionalities and then coded them. However, a different approach could have been creating UML diagrams to identify the classes and methods and then code them. I could follow both strategies in future projects.
